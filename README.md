# Customer_Segmentation

Given current competition within the market, it is essential to understand customer behaviour, their types, and their interests. Especially in targeted marketing, categorizing and understanding customers is a crucial step in forming effective marketing strategies. By creating customer segments, marketers can focus on one segment at a time and tailor their marketing strategies. For example, you have a hotel business, and you may target couples who have upcoming anniversaries and offer them a special romantic package. In this notebook, first clustering is applied to separate customers into clusters. To avoid suboptimal solution, mini-batch k-means applies multiple times to get average of centroids of clusters. Then based on the mean of features for each clusters, segments are defined. Finally, PCA algorithms is applied to visualize grouped customers. Required Python functions to run this notebook is in Appendix.
